# Zappy

Epitech Project - 2nd Year PGE


## Description

The goal of this project is to create a network game where several teams confront on a tiles map containing resources. Each team has players controlled by artificial intelligences.\
The objective is to collect resources to survive, reproduce and perform rituals to level up.\
The first team with 6 players at the maximum level wins the game ðŸŽ®

The project is divided in 3 parts:
- [Server](./server): created in C, it that generates the inhabitants' world and contains the game logic.
